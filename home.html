    <h3>Overview + Premise:</h3>
    <p>In CS1300, we were asked to create a list interface! I chose to create an app that is based off
      the legend of the Chinese Zodiac, where all the animals raced to impress the emperor and the first twelve
      animals earned a spot in the Zodiac. In my app, users can select which of the twelve Zodiac animals to 
      add to their own Race Team, and view the combined number of celestial legs (and therefore race power) their team has.
      <b>The final app is viewable <a href= "https://rocky-ocean-73846.herokuapp.com/">here<a>.</b>

    <h2>Goal of App</h2>
    <p>The goal of the application is to enable users to create a race team from the twelve Chinese Zodiac Animals.
      They can filter the animals by <b>Celestial Element</b> (Metal, Water, Fire, Earth, Wood) and <b>Yin/Yang Alignment</b>,
      as well as sort the animals by either <b>Race Order</b> (the order in which the animals completed the legendary race) or Reverse Race Order (
        so users can see which animals were fastest or slowest). Users can select or unselect animals for their team,
        and view the combined number of legs the team would have, a.k.a. the animal power of the chosen race team.
    </p>
    <h3>Value to Users</h3>
    <p>
      This app is useful to any user interested in learning more about the Chinese Zodiac animals. While many people are well-versed in
      Western Zodiacs and horoscopes, much less people are well educated about the Chinese Zodiac. Of the population of people who are aware
      of the Chinese Zodiac, most of them only know of the 
      existence of the animals, but are not familiar with the particular subcategories of characteristics that are integral to the 
      formation of the Zodiac. Such important characteristics include the animal's Celestial Element
      and Yin/Yang alignment, both of which I created filters for in my app so users can explore the specific animals
      in each category.

    <h2>Usability Principles Considered</h2>
    <h4>Visual Style Cohesiveness</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>
      With how prominent and recognizable traditional Chinese color schemes are (reds, golds, etc.) it was important for me to 
      have a strong visual style guide. I made sure my entire app adhered to a memorable color palette that was reminiscent of traditional
      Chinese ornamentation and aesthetics. 
    </li>
  </ul>
    <h4>Accessibility + Learnability</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>
      I wanted to make the app as easy to use as possible, and made sure the contrast between the text and background colors was enough
      to make everything readable.  
    </li>
    <li>
      The dropdown menus and filters, as well as the buttons and cards, are all consistent in visual design and function throughot the app to ensure ease
      of use and learnability.
    </li>
    <li>
      I used my jade green from my color palette as the accent color, knowing that it would differentiate itself
      drastically from the other warmer colors and stand out as a call-to-action color. Therefore, the buttons to reset all filters and 
      add/remove animals from the user's selected race team were green.
    </li> 
  </ul>
